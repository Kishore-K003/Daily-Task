### Learning EKS and Kubernetes

Today i learnt **Amazon EKS** and trying to understand how Kubernetes works on AWS.  

### What I learned

- **Cluster** – the main thing that holds all your apps and nodes.  
- **Fargate Profile** – lets pods run without worrying about EC2 servers.  
- **Deployment** – keeps your app running and handles updates.  
- **Service** – makes your app reachable inside the cluster or from the internet.  
- **Pod** – smallest unit, basically runs your container.  
- **Kubeconfig** – config file so `kubectl` can talk to the cluster.

### What I did

Tried deploying the same app which i built yesterday with a Deployment.yaml but got some errors and issues will try to complete tomorrow
